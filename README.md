# Car_Black_Box_Project

# Overview

The Car Black Box project is designed to record and store critical vehicle data, 
similar to an aircraft's black box. It captures and logs essential parameters such as 
speed, acceleration, brake status, and timestamped event data to help analyze driving patterns and accident causes.

# Features

  📌 Real-time data logging: Records key vehicle parameters at regular intervals.

  🚗 Crash/Event Detection: Logs sudden changes in acceleration and braking.

  💾 Persistent Storage: Saves data in a structured format for post-event analysis.

  🔍 Data Retrieval & Analysis: Allows users to extract and review stored logs.

# Future Enhancements

  🛰 Integration with GPS to log location-based event data.

  📶 Remote Data Transmission for real-time monitoring.

  📊 Graphical Visualization of recorded vehicle parameters.
